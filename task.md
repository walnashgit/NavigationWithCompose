## 🧠 Task details

This challenge requires you to create an app about **Books**.  
Please find screenshots of the UIs that should be implemented in the [screenshots](screenshots)

Your implementation should include the following:

1. Implement a **loading state** for the **Search Books** screen.
2. After loading, display a **list of books** along with a **search field**.
3. The height of the list item should be **120.dp**.
4. The image in the Book item should have an aspect ratio of **3:4**.
5. Use `TextField` for search input
6. Implement **search by name** functionality. The loading indicator shouldn't be visible during a search.
7. A simple animation should be applied to list items when they appear or disappear as a result of the search functionality.
8. When the **Details** button is clicked, navigate to the **Book Details** screen and pass the `bookId` as an argument.
